EMA’s call for extra staff comes as it is bracing itself for the the likely loss of employees when it moves from its current home in London.\n \n \nThe EMA is offering close to £32 million ($42 million) to contract staffing agencies that can provide it with employees to fill a wide variety of positions. The size of the contract sets it apart from recent EMA tenders. And, while it is normal for the EMA to use temporary staff to plug holes, the agency has acknowledged the latest contracts will address a situation that is far from routine. \n“[We] will also be using the framework contract to make up short-term for some staff losses expected to occur in the course of [the] relocation,” a spokesperson for the EMA told the Financial Times. \nThe agency's survey of its staff’s relocation plans suggest it is likely to lose anywhere from to 19% to 94% of its employees when it leaves London. Exactly how many opt against following the agency to its new home will depend on which city wins a vote on the relocation. Staff are more open to moving themselves and their families to some cities than others.\nHaving put out the contract, the EMA will have a source of staff to draw on as its relocates. The tender covers staff grouped into six lots. The job descriptions described in these lots cover office staff, IT administrators, law, public relations and roles involved in the authorization of medicines. \nThe EMA has set aside the largest slice of the tender—£8.8 million—for “scientific administrative staff ... with experience in medicine development or authorization of medicines.” The loss of capacity in these areas could affect the the agency’s ability to process drug approval applications, leading to delays in new medicines getting to patients. \n \n \nThe tender is part of a growing wave of regulatory hiring activity that has spread across Europe since the U.K. voted for Brexit.The EMA is responsible for some of the earlier activity, albeit on a far smaller scale than the latest tender. The agency signed off on its most recent set of temporary worker tender contracts in June, awarding €4.5 million for employees grouped into three lots. The latest tender is worth about eight times as much and features twice as many lots of workers.\nNational agencies are scaling up their operations in parallel, in part to help the EMA with the shortfall of capacity that will arise if it severs ties to the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Spain, one of the countries in the running to host EMA, is currently hiring 40 people in a recruitment drive specifically designed to mitigate the fallout from Brexit."}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1507304934142},"timestamp":1507304934142,"sequenceNumber":0}}

Now the vaccine has notched another success—this time in a phase 1 trial in people who received up to three injections of the compound.\n \n \nTwo weeks after volunteers for the trial received the final dose, they all developed Zika-specific antibodies and 80% of them developed neutralizing antibodies, which help cells defend against pathogens, according to a statement. There were no significant side effects. The trial was conducted in partnership with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Inovio Pharmaceuticals and GeneOne Life Science.\nSynthetic DNA vaccines work by instructing the body to mount an immune response to a foreign invader. The Zika vaccine, called GLS-5700, produces a response against a specific antigen—in essence rallying antibodies and T cells in the immune system to neutralize the virus. After each dose, trial participants were given electroporation, or small electric zaps on their skin at the injection site, which was meant to improve vaccine uptake.\nRELATED: One step closer to a Zika vaccine for pregnant women \nIn the earlier animal trials, GLS-5700 prevented Zika from invading the brain. That could prove significant, in light of the fact that the biggest risk of the virus is that it can cause the brain defect microcephaly in infants.\nInovio and GeneOne are among more than a dozen life science companies that are racing to develop Zika vaccines. Other players include GlaxoSmithKline, which is working with the National Institutes of Health on a technology called self-amplifying mRNA (SAM). Like DNA technology, SAM does not rely on using attenuated versions of live viruses, like most vaccines do.\n \n \nAt least one potential competitor is out of the race, however. Sanofi was working on a vaccine called Zika purified inactivated virus (ZPIV), which was initially developed by the U.S. Army’s Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. But in September, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), retreated from the development project, prompting Sanofi to pull the plug on its Zika vaccine development efforts.\nRELATED: Protease inhibitor a potential new avenue for Zika treatment \nGLS-5700 was developed in a few short months, according to David Weiner, director of Wistar’s Vaccine & Immunotherapy Center. That could be an important advantage of DNA vaccines, he added, particularly when dealing with viruses that can mutate over time. The platform, he said in the statement, “has advantages in temperature stability, storage, dose and distribution compared to most traditional vaccines, making DNA vaccines an important tool to respond quickly to curb an emerging epidemic.”\nThe vaccine will need further testing to fully determine efficacy, the research team says. But they believe the DNA technology could be used to create vaccines against many other diseases, including Ebola, West Nile virus and pandemic flu."}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1507304935984},"timestamp":1507304935984,"sequenceNumber":1}}

The metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors (MBLI) are designed to inactivate the NDM-1 mechanism, rendering drug-resistant bacteria vulnerable to beta-lactam antibiotics.\n \n \nPublic-private partnership AMRC will now advance the research-stage program from its base at the old AstraZeneca site at Alderley Park. AMRC will give Medivir a cut of any money it makes from the licensing, sale or commercialization of the recently transferred knowledge and compounds.\nPlenty of work stands between AMRC and such earnings. But in licensing compounds with the potential to tackle the NDM-1 resistance mechanism, it has taken the first steps on a route that could lead to it addressing a major public health threat. \nBacteria containing NDM-1 have spread around the world since first being identified in India in 2008. The alarm caused by the spread of the gene stems from its ability to render bacteria resistant to carbapenems, the beta-lactam antibiotics doctors use to blast bugs that are invulnerable to their traditional weapons. \nSome VCs and biotechs have responded to the threat with money and R&D attention. VenatoRx Pharmaceuticals picked up $42 million in series B funds in July to take a drug designed to inhibit the four major classes of beta‐lactamase resistance enzymes—including metallo‐beta‐lactamases such as NDM-1—through to registration.\nAMRC thinks the work done by Medivir suggests the compounds it has licensed have a shot at making it that far, too. \n \n “Medivir has done a lot of very good science and we are delighted to be able to take forward the MBLI program aiming to address important emerging resistance mechanisms and targeting drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens on the WHO's critical priority list,” Peter Jackson, Ph.D., executive director at AMRC, said in a statement. \n \n \nThe deal comes weeks after AMRC entered into a co-development agreement with Microbiotix. \nFor Medivir, the deal continues its retreat from infectious diseases. The sector was a cornerstone of Medivir until Gilead’s Sovaldi blew a hole in its hepatitis C plans, prompting it to lay off 30 people and refocus on cancer 12 months ago. Since then, Medivir has tried to sell off what was left of its infectious disease pipeline, leading to a deal with Ascletis and today’s agreement with AMRC."}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1507304937155},"timestamp":1507304937155,"sequenceNumber":4}}

The result is a relentless deterioration to a vegetative state or death within a few years of diagnosis.\nBluebird’s gene therapy “has effectively arrested the progress” of cALD in 88% of boys treated, said lead study author David Williams, M.D., of Boston Children's Hospital and the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center in a release. He cautioned, however, that more follow-up is needed to get a picture of the duration of response and the long-term safety of the therapy.\nAll patients who participated in the clinical trial were expressing functional ALD protein, which their bodies had been unable to produce prior to gene therapy. The 15 responding patients were all in the early stages of cALD at enrollment and met the primary objective of being alive and with no major functional disability 24 months after infusion of Lenti-D. One boy died as a consequence of the disease during the study, and another has progressed despite the treatment.\n \n \nIt is one of the largest gene therapy trials targeting a single-gene disease to be published to date and has been granted regulatory approval to expand the number of patients. The boys enrolled to date have been offered the chance to participate in a 13-year study to gauge their long-term response.\nWilliams said that because the therapy uses the patient’s own cells, it overcomes the challenges of finding a matched sibling donor which can delay or even prevent treatment.\n“The founding of bluebird bio was based in large part on the potential for Lenti-D to benefit boys with cALD,” said David Davidson, M.D., the company’s chief medical officer, in the release. “It is encouraging to see patients doing clinically well more than three years following treatment for this rare and devastating disease.”\nThe new data is a boost for Bluebird, which has been trying to rebuild confidence in its gene therapy portfolio after its LentiGlobin candidate for sickle cell disease failed to hit the mark in a clinical trial.\nOther companies working on new therapies for ALD include NeuroVia, which recently raised $14 million in a series A round to fund its small-molecule NV1205 candidate; Minoryx Therapeutics, which has a PPAR gamma agonist MIN-102 in phase 1/2 testing, and MedDay Pharma, which has said it expects to report phase 2b/3 results with its biotin-based MD1003 candidate by the end of this year."}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1507304940761},"timestamp":1507304940761,"sequenceNumber":6}}

The extension puts Visterra back on the multifront path through the clinic it plotted out before its aborted IPO attempt.\n \n \nCambridge, MA-based Visterra went to Wall Street during a dip in biotech IPOs and found investors unreceptive to its pitch. But, as CEO Brian Pereira, M.D., said shortly after that setback, Visterra has a strong syndicate of private investors. Many of these backers, aided by the support of a clutch of new investors, have stepped up to fund Visterra to the next stage in its evolution. \nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Merck’s VC wing, Polaris Partners and Flagship Pioneering are among the big-name Visterra backers to return for the series C extension. New investors Serum Institute of India, CTI Life Sciences and Allegheny Financial also put up cash.\nRaising the $23.6 million extension brings the series C total up to $46.7 million, although, as the IPO filing made clear, Visterra had worked its way through a chunk of the original 2016 round by this time last year. The dwindling of Visterra’s bank balance to less than $15 million and growth of its R&D budget needs prompted the attempted $50 million IPO. \nVisterra has returned from private investors with notably less than that, although the series C will be enough to move key assets past milestones. Most importantly, Visterra now has the money to wrap up a phase 2a of influenza A treatment VIS410 in ambulatory patients and start a phase 2b of the same monoclonal antibody in hospitalized patients.\nBoth events are due to happen early next year. Visterra had hoped to get VIS410 into the phase 2b in the first half of this year, but the IPO misstep thwarted that plan. That pre-IPO target was itself later than Visterra once hoped. VIS410’s smooth passage through the clinic was blocked in March 2016 when the FDA hit Visterra’s phase 2a with a partial clinical hold that lasted six months. The FDA lifted that hold after a phase 1 trial dispelled its concerns about gastrointestinal safety. \n \n \nWith the regulatory barrier removed and money in the bank, Visterra now has everything in place to move forward and generate data to support another run at Wall Street or the deal it mooted as one option for VIS410 after the aborted IPO.\nVisterra earmarked $7 million to $9 million for the BARDA-supported phase 2b at the time of the attempted IPO, meaning a slice of the series C extension is free for other programs. Chief among these programs is VIS649, an IgA nephropathy product candidate Visterra is moving toward the clinic."}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1507304941141},"timestamp":1507304941141,"sequenceNumber":7}}

But it comes with some safety concerns, namely, off-target gene editing that may bring about harmful side effects such as cancer. A team at UC Berkeley is investigating the possibility that nanoparticles can address these problems.\n \n \nThe three components of CRISPR—the Cas9 enzyme, a guide RNA and donor DNA—are delivered using a viral vector, most commonly an adeno-associated virus (AAV). While this is the most advanced method of CRISPR delivery, it allows the Cas9 enzyme to persist in the cells, as there is no way to control Cas9 expression once the enzyme is in the cells, said Niren Murthy, a professor of bioengineering at UC Berkeley.\nSo, even after editing is complete, the Cas9 will be “chewing up” parts of the genome, which can cause mutations, Murthy said. Additionally, AAVs are too small to fit all three CRISPR components, so at least two viruses must be used. A large dose of viruses—higher than what is clinically recommended—must be injected in order to get the intended effect, he said.\nRELATED: RNA-targeting CRISPR could yield treatments for Huntington's, ALS\nMurthy worked on a study investigating the use of a nonviral, nanoparticle delivery vehicle for CRISPR, developed by GenEdit. The technology, dubbed CRISPR-Gold, is made up of gold nanoparticles combined with DNA. This is complexed with all three CRISPR components, as well as a polymer that helps the nanoparticle penetrate into cells.\nThe researchers delivered CRISPR-Gold to mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy via intramuscular injection. They injected the three CRISPR components without a delivery vehicle into another group of mice, which served as a negative control. They chose Duchenne because it lacks effective treatments and because it affects skeletal muscle, an area into which gene therapy can be easily injected, said GenEdit CEO Kunwoo Lee.\n \n \nRELATED: Shortened telomeres linked to heart damage in Duchenne muscular dystrophy\nTwo weeks after a single injection, CRISPR-Gold corrected the mutated dystrophin gene and restored the expression of the dystrophin protein in the mice’s muscle tissue with minimal off-target effects, according to the study. Specifically, the treatment corrected 5.4% of the dystrophin gene in the mice, a promising result, the team believes. In additional experiments, mice treated with CRISPR-Gold showed better strength and agility than mice treated in the negative control group. The findings appear in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering.\nOther research on safer CRISPR focuses on using proteins as an “off switch” for gene editing. Scientists from the University of Toronto and the University of Massachusetts identified three families of proteins that bind to the Cas9 enzyme, halting its activity. And a team from UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco applied an anti-CRISPR protein to a CRISPR-Cas9 molecule that reduced off-target effects fourfold without compromising the desired gene editing.\nWhile Sarepta’s Duchenne drug earned FDA approval last year, it is only effective in a narrow group of patients. CRISPR could become a treatment for the approximately 30% of Duchenne patients whose disease is caused by single-base mutations or small deletions, the Berkeley researchers said."}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1507304942163},"timestamp":1507304942163,"sequenceNumber":8}}

So the Baylor researchers wanted to see what would happen if they turned off the pathway altogether. When they silenced Hippo for 6 weeks in mouse models of heart failure, they were able to restore pumping ability to that of healthy hearts, according to a press release. The research was published in the journal Nature.\nRELATED: Merck KGaA steps up Hippo pathway cancer pact with CRT \nBecause blood flow stops during a heart attack, muscle tissue can die. That dead muscle is replaced by scar tissue that’s unable to help the heart to pump. Over time, the heart continues to weaken, leading to chronic heart failure in most people. The Baylor team recognized that Hippo signaling activity increases during a heart attack, suggesting a link between the pathway and the heart’s inability to repair itself.\nThe effort to find new ways of combating heart disease is largely aimed at promoting regeneration of damaged heart muscle. In May, Japanese scientists identified a signaling protein called urocortin2 (Ucn2) that’s elevated in people with chronic heart failure. When they used this protein to silence another protein called corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 (Crhr2), they were able to prevent the loss of cardiac function in mouse models.\nCell therapy is also a potential treatment for heart failure. In the spring, Australian biotech company Mesoblast released positive data from a trial of mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) that are delivered straight into the left ventricular muscle of heart failure patients. Several other companies are investigating different cell-based approaches to promoting heart regeneration.\n \n \nRELATED: Vivace uncloaks with $40M, U.S.-China backing for cancer trials \nThe scientists at Baylor have a theory about why inhibiting the Hippo pathway might prove to be an effective regenerative therapy: It seems to alter the abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, or “fibrosis,” that is seen in heart failure, in addition to encouraging cardiac muscle cells to grow and survive in injured hearts. The team plans further studies to shed light on how inhibiting Hippo affects fibrosis."}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1507304944333},"timestamp":1507304944333,"sequenceNumber":11}}
