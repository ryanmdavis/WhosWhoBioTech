So the Baylor researchers wanted to see what would happen if they turned off the pathway altogether. When they silenced Hippo for 6 weeks in mouse models of heart failure, they were able to restore pumping ability to that of healthy hearts, according to a press release. The research was published in the journal Nature.\nRELATED: Merck KGaA steps up Hippo pathway cancer pact with CRT \nBecause blood flow stops during a heart attack, muscle tissue can die. That dead muscle is replaced by scar tissue that’s unable to help the heart to pump. Over time, the heart continues to weaken, leading to chronic heart failure in most people. The Baylor team recognized that Hippo signaling activity increases during a heart attack, suggesting a link between the pathway and the heart’s inability to repair itself.\nThe effort to find new ways of combating heart disease is largely aimed at promoting regeneration of damaged heart muscle. In May, Japanese scientists identified a signaling protein called urocortin2 (Ucn2) that’s elevated in people with chronic heart failure. When they used this protein to silence another protein called corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 (Crhr2), they were able to prevent the loss of cardiac function in mouse models.\nCell therapy is also a potential treatment for heart failure. In the spring, Australian biotech company Mesoblast released positive data from a trial of mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) that are delivered straight into the left ventricular muscle of heart failure patients. Several other companies are investigating different cell-based approaches to promoting heart regeneration.\n \n \nRELATED: Vivace uncloaks with $40M, U.S.-China backing for cancer trials \nThe scientists at Baylor have a theory about why inhibiting the Hippo pathway might prove to be an effective regenerative therapy: It seems to alter the abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, or “fibrosis,” that is seen in heart failure, in addition to encouraging cardiac muscle cells to grow and survive in injured hearts. The team plans further studies to shed light on how inhibiting Hippo affects fibrosis."}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1507226716657},"timestamp":1507226716657,"sequenceNumber":3}}

The data tee Motif Bio up to file for approval of a drug that was knocked back by the FDA in 2009 and almost sunk the biotech 12 months ago.\n \n \nIn the trial of 600 patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), iclaprim held its own against vancomycin, one of the incumbent antibiotics. The iclaprim arm recorded an early clinical response rate of 78.3%, as compared to 76.7% in the vancomycin cohort. That result was enough for the trial to hit its primary endpoint of noninferiority.\nIclaprim also matched vancomycin against the predefined secondary clinical cure endpoint.\nPublication of the data comes six months after Motif Bio released a similar set of results from the first of the two phase 3 trials. With iclaprim performing comparably to vancomycin in both trials, Motif Bio plans to file for approval from the FDA in the first quarter of next year.\nThat will mark the end of iclaprim’s multiyear journey back to the FDA. Roche spinoff Arpida got as far as an advisory committee in 2008, only for the experts to savage its submission and the FDA to follow their lead and reject the drug.\nCriticism of the original filing centered on its failure to dispel doubts about the efficacy of iclaprim. Arpida used a 12.5% noninferiority margin, rather than the 10% favored by the FDA, and delivered data that left some of the experts convened by the FDA thinking iclaprim was inferior to linezolid.\n \n \nThe addition of a questionable safety profile, particularly relating to iclaprim’s prolongation of QT intervals, left the panelists with little reason to be flexible about the noninferiority margin.\n“QTc is certainly an issue. It's very difficult to know the exact consequences of elevated QTc but those issues are also influential. So it's not a setting where I can say there's safety issues that are favorable and that in some sense could argue for adjusting the margin,” Thomas Fleming, professor of biostatistics at the University of Washington, said (PDF) at the 2008 meeting. \nMotif Bio now looks set to take iclaprim back to the FDA armed with data that show it meeting the 10% bar for noninferiority, albeit against a different comparator than was used in the previous trials. A meta-analysis published in 2015 found the old and current comparators—linezolid and vancomycin—have equivalent efficacy in ABSSSI, although some earlier reviews suggest the former has the edge. \nThat leaves some scope for the FDA to question the efficacy data but, given vancomycin is widely used in the treatment of ABSSSI, the results in support of iclaprim are meaningful. Reviewers will also look for evidence of iclaprim’s effect on QT intervals. The 2008 panelists saw this as a cause to restrict use of iclaprim but not necessarily a barrier to its approval altogether. \nMotif Bio’s share price increased more than 30% following publication of the top-line data, moving the stock back up toward the levels it hovered around for much of 2015 and 2016. The stock fell into a trough 12 months ago, around the time Motif Bio warned it lacked the money to keep going. \nA Nasdaq IPO and placement in Europe gave Motif Bio the means to reach its first phase 3 trial readout, rescuing the biotech and ultimately leading iclaprim to the cusp of a return to the FDA."}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1507226723154},"timestamp":1507226723154,"sequenceNumber":8}}

Massachusetts startup Palleon Pharmaceuticals has raised $47.6 million to fund the development of drugs that target sugar-sensing molecules on the surfaces of cells.\n \n \nThe biotech has been launched to target ‘glycoimmune’ checkpoints—which it describes as receptors on immune cells that normally distinguish ‘self’ from ‘non-self’ cells but get exploited in cancer to create immunosuppression that allows tumors to thrive.\n“When first-generation T-cell checkpoint inhibitors work, they work extremely well, but unfortunately the majority of patients still do not respond,” Jim Broderick, M.D., Palleon’s CEO and founder, told FierceBiotech. “This is because most tumors utilize multiple strategies to thwart the immune system, and T-cell checkpoint inhibition is insufficient to drive a response alone.”\n“The next chapter of immuno-oncology will need to employ a coordinated effort of both innate (dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer cells) and the adaptive (T-cells) immune cells to overcome this multilayered resistance,” he added.\nThe biotech—which was set up in 2015 and incubated and launched from SR One’s Cambridge, Massachusetts, office where Broderick served as entrepreneur-in-residence—says it has licensed intellectual property related to glycoimmune checkpoints from its co-founders Carolyn Bertozzi, Ph.D., of Stanford University, and Paul Crocker, Ph.D., of Dundee University in the U.K.\nTheir work has built on decades of research which has shown that some glycan patterns on tumor cells—such as a motif known as ‘hypersialylation’—are associated with poor clinical outcomes, and it is thought that these patterns help hide the cells from the immune system.\n \n \nThe company isn’t giving away anything about specific targets other than to say it has three lead programs and certainly isn’t speculating about when it will be able to start clinical trials. The CEO said, however, that the approach could be of value in cancers defined by “certain cell surface and shed mucin glycan patterns,” which include solid tumors such as colon, breast and lung cancers, as well as some hematological malignancies.\nGlycoimmune checkpoints are expressed on a broader range of innate as well as adaptive immune cells critical to an antitumor response compared to other targets, he added. Targeting them “offers the potential to awaken a broader spectrum of the immune system in tumor types that are not responsive to first generation immuno-oncology drugs.”\nThe series A funding comes from SR One as well as Pfizer Ventures, Vertex Ventures HC, Takeda Ventures and AbbVie Ventures, and will be used to building out Palleon’s platform and get product development underway.\nBroderick said Palleon has 15 employees today and expects that headcount to “expand considerably” over the next year.\n“The most meaningful breakthroughs often occur at the intersection of diverse and seemingly unrelated scientific disciplines. Palleon was spawned by bringing together new findings in glycoscience and human immunology, which resulted in unexpected implications for oncology.”\n“The convergence of these two fields has enabled us to develop a novel class of medicines that could have a significant impact on the lives of cancer patients.”"}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1507226724053},"timestamp":1507226724053,"sequenceNumber":9}}

Edasalonexent (a.k.a. CAT-1004) is an oral NF-kB inhibitor and—unlike other DMD therapies such as Sarepta's injectable Exondys 51 (eteplirsen), which was approved last year for a specific genetically defined group of patients—could potentially be used in patients regardless of their underlying mutation, says the company.\nRELATED: FDA expert lashes out at 'worrisome' Sarepta approval in JAMA\nBut back in February, the Cambridge, MA-based biotech said the Part B of its so-called \"MoveDMD\" phase 2 trial, which was always the bigger test, failed to beat out placebo in 31 Duchenne patients with the measure of change in lower leg muscles.\nIts shares were routed, and closed at just $1.38 at the end of trading when the news was posted.\n \n \nRELATED: Catabasis routed after DMD trial failure\nBut the company pointed to an open-label extension portion of this test, known as Part C, that was still ongoing. Today, it revealed those data, which it says showed “positive efficacy” in regards to sustained disease-modifying effects, following 24 and 36 weeks of treatment with its med.\nAcross all key assessments of muscle function, the biotech reports that improvements were observed in the rate of decline after 24 and 36 weeks of oral 100 mg/kg/day edasalonexent treatment, when compared to the rate of change in the control period for boys prior to receiving edasalonexent treatment.\nThese data provide “clinically meaningful evidence” that edasalonexent “substantially slowed the progression of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD),” the company said in statement.\nIt also said that “supportive changes in measures of muscle health” were seen, with muscle enzymes “significantly decreased” compared to baseline at 12 weeks and later time points (p < 0.05) and lower leg muscle MRI T2 rate of change was significantly improved in comparison to progression during the control period (p ≤ 0.05). No further detailed statistical data were shared.\nCatabasis added that “no safety signals” were observed in the trial.\nThe biotech says with these latest data, along with a “supportive regulatory input from FDA,” it is now plotting a global phase 3 of edasalonexent in patients with DMD regardless of mutation type in the first half of 2018, with top-line results expected in 2020.\nThis test will be randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled and will have “many elements in common” with the phase 2, including the patient population and endpoints. It will seek to enroll about 125 patients aged four to seven who have not been on steroids for at least six months.\nThe primary endpoint will be change in the North Star Ambulatory Assessment score after 12 months of treatment with edasalonexent compared to placebo. This will prove to be a make-or-break trial for the med.\n“We are extremely excited to see edasalonexent change the trajectory of disease in the MoveDMD trial with substantially slowed disease progression,” said Jill Milne, Ph.D., CEO of Catabasis.\n“Boys treated with edasalonexent stabilized; they experienced meaningful improvements in muscle function compared to the rates of change observed during the control period. Importantly, other supportive positive measures of muscle health were observed. We look forward to advancing edasalonexent as a disease-modifying therapy in a single phase 3 pivotal trial as soon as possible with the goal of providing a meaningful impact on disease progression for all boys affected by Duchenne,\" she said.\nAside from last year’s controversial approval of Sarepta’s DMD drug, research and regulatory updates for this rare but devastating muscle-wasting disease have been poor. Just last week, a panel of experts convened by the FDA overwhelmingly knocked back PTC Therapeutics’ filing for approval of ataluren in DMD.\nThe experts panned PTC for relying on post hoc analyses, not all of which were convincing, to make its case for approving the drug.\nPTC pushed through to an advisory committee meeting despite ataluren having come up short in two clinical trials. The FDA refused to review applications from PTC following both clinical missteps."}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1507226730998},"timestamp":1507226730998,"sequenceNumber":10}}
