Today, it’s testing the waters in peanut allergy with Aimmune’s FDA Breakthrough-tagged AR101, its investigational biologic.\nThe three companies are planning a 2018 midstage test of AR101 with adjunctive dupilumab in peanut-allergic patients; Regeneron will sponsor the trial, with Aimmune bringing AR101 and food challenge materials to the table.\nThe proposed primary endpoint is set to be tolerating a certain dose of peanut protein in a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge that will include doses matching, and indeed exceeding, those being tested in current AR101 trials. \n \n \n“We are excited to work with Regeneron and Sanofi to explore the potential of AR101 and dupilumab to increase both the degree of protection and persistence of protection against exposure to peanut protein,” said Aimmune CEO Stephen Dilly, Ph.D. “We have worked diligently with regulatory authorities and have engineered a manufacturing infrastructure that is purpose-built to meet strict cGMP and quality standards, an essential component for conducting rigorous studies such as this.”\nIn March 2016, AR101 helped the majority of allergy sufferers in a phase 2 trial consume peanuts safely. The trial was an extension of an earlier midstage study that tested AR101 versus placebo. Aimmune merged the two patient groups from the prior trial, gradually increasing the dosage for the former placebo arm and then giving each group daily doses of AR101 for 12 weeks.\nIn the end, the drug protected 100% of patients who ate 443 mg of peanuts, 90% of those who ate 1,043 mg and 60% who ate 2,043 mg. A single peanut generally measures at about 300 mg, according to the company.\nAnd the $1.72 billion market cap biotech got a boost last November when Nestlé Health Science invested $145 million into the Brisbane, California-based company, as well as penning a two-year collaboration designed to “enable the successful development and commercialization of innovative food allergy therapies.”"}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1508184892875},"timestamp":1508184892875,"sequenceNumber":0}}

The antisense drug triggered a 20-point improvement against a score of neuropathy impairment, laying a marker for the upcoming showdown with Alnylam.\n \n \nCarlsbad, California-based Ionis posted top-line data from the trial in May. Back then, Ionis said the trial linked the transthyretin-targeting antisense drug to a statistically significant improvement in mean neuropathy impairment score—known as mNIS+7—after 15 months but didn’t discuss the numbers. \nNow, Ionis has disclosed a 20-point mNIS+7 improvement and accompanying 0.00000004 p value. Those involved with the study think the improvement is clinically meaningful. \n“A 20-point benefit in mNIS+7 is unprecedented and could mean the difference between the ability to walk and being confined to a wheelchair for patients suffering from this debilitating and fatal disease,” Annabel Wang, M.D., an associate professor of neurology at the University of California and an investigator in the NEURO-TTR trial, said in a statement.\nIonis also trumpeted the fact the change in mNIS+7 reached statistical significance after eight months. That figure could play an important role in the coming months and years as Ionis seeks to paint inotersen as a better bet for hATTR patients than Alnylam’s patisiran, which came through its own phase 3 test last month.\nRELATED: Alnylam’s patisiran hits all endpoints in critical phase 3\n \n \nAlnylam is yet to present a close look at data from its trial. That is set to change at an ATTR meeting in Paris early next month that will provide an early yardstick for which company is likely to prevail. Alnylam’s presentation is scheduled for 11:00 a.m. Ionis will take the stage at 11:20 a.m.\nFor people seeking to read the tea leaves, the safety slides will hold as much interest as those on the efficacy of the rival drugs. Ionis’ stock has been rocked repeatedly by reports of low platelet levels and other serious side effects. Ionis has maintained that inotersen has a manageable risk profile, a position it again adopted for the latest data drop without providing safety data from the trial to support its position. \nThe biotech is closing in on the day it has to make this argument to regulators. Ionis plans to file for approval before the end of the year. And, having been dropped by GlaxoSmithKline in August, it has sole control of the asset as it navigates the final few turns of the race to market."}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1508184893796},"timestamp":1508184893796,"sequenceNumber":1}}

The Big Pharma will pay up to $387 million to license and advance certain classes from the more than 100 groups of possibly novel antibiotics Warp Drive is analyzing.\n \n \nWarp Drive will receive up to $87 million through an upfront payment, option fees and preclinical milestones. Those payments cover the work Warp Drive will do, with Roche’s input on strategy and prioritization, to get development candidates ready for its partner to take forward. Beyond that, Roche is on the hook for up to $300 million in clinical, regulatory and sales milestones.\nThe deal gives Roche access to a rare natural source of novel classes of potential antibiotics and will leave Warp Drive with worldwide rights to classes of antibiotics not taken forward by Roche. \nSuch novel classes of natural antibiotics used to flow out of pharma research labs at a reasonable rate. But the faucet ran dry more than 30 years ago, contributing to companies cutting investment in the sector shortly before the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria began dialing up the need for novel antibiotics. \nWarp Drive’s answer is to go back to the soil armed with modern technologies. The approach to drug discovery pairs a bacterial genome database with bioinformatics tools to identify genes that code for the synthesis of novel natural products. Warp Drive extracts these genes and analyzes natural products they express, before tweaking the resulting potential antibiotics with chemical technologies to create drug candidates. \n“It enables us to do discovery of natural products more comprehensively and on a larger scale … than the industry was historically able to do,” Warp Drive CEO Laurence Reid, Ph.D., said.\n \n \nThat has proven to be an attractive proposition to Big Pharma. Warp Drive emerged in 2012 with A-listed founders—Gregory Verdine, Ph.D., George Church, Ph.D., and James Wells, Ph.D.—and investors, plus a deal that would allow Sanofi to buy it at a later date. Sanofi set Warp Drive free last year when it dropped its option in favor of a multiasset, $750 million collaboration.\nRELATED: Sanofi drops option, inks $750M R&D collaboration with Warp Drive Bio\nWarp Drive celebrated its freedom by striking a cancer deal with GlaxoSmithKline and now the antibiotic pact with Roche. \nThe new deal is notable for its focus on novel, natural classes of antibiotics that hit drug-resistant, Gram-negative pathogens. Warp Drive has worked on antibiotics with Sanofi, but its earlier forays into the field aimed to find new drugs in existing classes. The Roche deal goes a step further by hunting for novel classes of natural antibiotics, something no researcher has found in decades. \nBig Pharma’s retreat from antibiotic drug discovery has potentially contributed to the slump in output. Roche bucked the trend by re-entering the field a few years back, striking a string of deals with biotechs forging ahead in the then-unfashionable sector.\nIn parallel, perceptions of the potential of the field among the people who perform and fund some early-stage research have started to shift.\n“I think there's increasing recognition in the biotech sector and [among] people who invest in biotech companies that innovation in this field is so badly needed from a global medical perspective that it becomes a potentially interesting area in which to invest,” Reid said."}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1508184896005},"timestamp":1508184896005,"sequenceNumber":4}}

If a patient is taken off treatment, or doesn’t stick to his or her drug regimen, virus levels can quickly bounce back.\n \n \nAn approach involving chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells could be the answer to containing HIV spread in the absence of antiretroviral therapy.\nAdding a synthetic CAR protein to T cells makes them better able to fight a specific target, such as cancer or HIV. CAR-T therapy involves extracting a patient’s T cells, re-engineering them in a lab to express specific CAR proteins and then injecting the beefed-up T cells back into the patient.\nCAR-T technology came to the forefront in August, when Novartis won approval for Kymriah, the first such therapy to treat some patients with lymphoma. Kite Pharma is expected to gain FDA approval for its CAR-T cancer treatment soon. Using engineered T cells to fight HIV is not a new idea, but previous attempts have seen limited success.\nRELATED: ‘Hit-and-run’ gene therapy nanoparticles could enhance CAR-T treatments\nWhile a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, Rachel Leibman worked to improve an existing CAR-T treatment. Her team “systematically tweaked” various parts of the CAR protein, including the vector backbone and signaling domains, to boost the T cells’ ability to control HIV replication.\n \n \nTesting it in the lab, they found it was 50 times more effective than the original CAR in preventing viral spread between human cells. The new and improved CAR-T cells staved off a rebound of HIV levels in mice that had been taken off antiretrovirals and also protected the mice’s T cells from being depleted by the virus.\nRELATED: Tick saliva-based drug could lower heart disease risk in HIV patients\nThe data, which appear in PLOS Pathogens, suggest that a CAR-T approach could provide “durable control” of HIV without the need for antiretrovirals. The researchers plan to bring the concept into the clinic.\nRELATED: Kite's CAR-T medication, cancer candidates draw choosy Gilead for $12B pipeline-building buyout\nScientists have long sought a cure for HIV, but the virus remains a tricky foe. Because it can hide itself in infected cells, it is difficult to tell if a patient is truly cured. A University of Pittsburgh team devised a test that quickly spots dormant and replicating HIV, while University of Montreal researchers have tried inhibiting the mTOR pathway to prevent HIV from replicating in the gut.\nGene editing could be a possible treatment too. A Temple University team safely used CRISPR to edit HIV out of the genome of human T cells last year. Excision BioTherapeutics, which recently picked up $10 million in seed funding, was founded on this research. Following promising results in mouse models, the company intends to start human testing of its CRISPR-based treatment."}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1508184900236},"timestamp":1508184900236,"sequenceNumber":6}}

Impassioned testimony from people treated with the therapy also played its part.\nIn the primary phase 3 trial used to back the application for Luxturna, 93% of the participants showed some improvement in their functional vision as measured by their ability to navigate obstacles in low light—a measured known as the bilateral multiluminance mobility test (MLMT).\nPeople with biallelic RPE65-mediated IRD are born with poor vision and typically go on to lose their sight completely. Those treated in Spark’s study showed functional improvements at 30 days—the therapy can’t restore normal sight—and that was maintained out to one year and in one case out to four years after dosing.\nPatients described what that level of improvement meant to their daily lives, for example allowing them to read facial expressions, recognize colors and go out at night.\n \n \nAlbert Maguire, M.D., of the Scheie Eye Institute, who led the trial, said: “As a practicing physician who often speaks with patients and families living with IRDs, these conversations have been, up to now, frustrating in that there has been nothing to offer. \n“Today’s advisory committee vote is an important step closer to the day that discussion can include potentially treating the blindness caused by their IRD.”\nPhiladelphia-based Spark said the positive vote “moves us closer to bringing this investigational adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene therapy to patients,” while analysts at Jefferies said approval by the FDA would be a “watershed moment” for the entire gene therapy field.\nWith approval looking likely, the conversation has swiftly switched to pricing, but the biotech isn’t revealing its plans on that just yet, saying it will do so once FDA has delivered its verdict. Some analysts have suggested, however, that a price tag of $1 million could be on the cards, following in the footsteps of uniQure and its Glybera for lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD), which was the first gene therapy to be approved in Europe.\nuniQure’s therapy was a commercial disaster, however, and was withdrawn from the market earlier this year due to lack of demand. GlaxoSmithKline was the second company to get the OK for a gene therapy in Europe and priced its product—Strimvelis for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to adenosine deaminase deficiency—at a more modest $650,000 a year, but hasn’t said much about takeup.\nThe closest comparator for Luxturna to date is Novartis’ CAR-T therapy Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), which has a one-off treatment price of $475,000 but addresses a larger patient population, and most observers seem to expect Luxturna to come in a little higher than that.\nThe panel vote is just one of a number of positive developments for Spark of late, coming after encouraging data for its hemophilia A and Pfizer-partnered hemophilia B programs and the filing of Luxturna in Europe.\nShares in the company were up nearly 8% in after-hours trading and have been rising steadily over the last six months on expectations that Luxturna was heading for approval."}]}]}]},"pageData":{"statusCode":200,"timestamp":1508184902022},"timestamp":1508184902022,"sequenceNumber":10}}
